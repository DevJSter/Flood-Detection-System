# Flood Detection System

ðŸŒŠ **Advance Warning System for Floods with Rainfall Analysis** ðŸŒŠ

## Approach

Disaster response is a critical phase of the disaster management cycle, encompassing various essential elements such as warning systems, evacuation plans, search and rescue operations, providing immediate assistance, damage assessment, continuous support, and rapid restoration.

In our efforts to enhance disaster response, we have developed an advance warning system for floods. Our system offers a user-friendly interface to the general public, enabling them to monitor water flow levels in rivers and receive notifications in case of potential floods within the next 12 months. Users can also access historical river flow trends and visualize rainfall patterns in their specific Sub-Division (area).

With this comprehensive information, individuals and communities can proactively prepare and minimize the impact of floods by taking necessary precautions and alerting the local population.

## Steps Taken in the Process

1. **Connection to HTML:** Users issue a request for the root URL `/` to access the index page of our application. The server maps the URL to a Python function.
2. **URL and Backend Connection:** The Flask framework is utilized to create an instance of the application. The URL `/` is mapped to the function `index()`, which renders the `index.html` template residing in the `templates/` folder. The rendered HTML is then sent back to the browser for display.

## Embracing Disaster Preparedness

Our Flood Detection System empowers communities to be proactive in disaster preparedness. By providing real-time data on river flow levels and rainfall patterns, individuals can make informed decisions and stay ahead of potential floods. This tool enhances public safety and helps minimize the impact of natural disasters on human lives and property.
